Bitext - Arabic Lemmatization Lookup Tables
===========================================

Overview
--------
This directory contains lemmatization lookup tables for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). These tables are a part of our [Modern Standard Arabic Lexical Data Resource](https://www.bitext.com/arabic-lexical-data/).

Contents
--------
The file [ara-lxd-lemma-10k.tsv](ara-lxd-lemma-10k.tsv) contains a subset of our MSA lemmatization dictionary covering the top 10,000 most frequent words appearing in Bitext's own corpus (which contains over 5B tokens and is well-balanced with respect to text typology, texts sources and verticals). These 10,000 words cover approximately 65% of our corpus.

The file is in Tabbed-Separated Values (TSV) format, and has two columns:
- form: the word form itself as it appears in the corpus
- lemma: the corresponding lemma (the canonical dictionary form)
