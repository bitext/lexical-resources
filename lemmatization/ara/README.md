Overview

This directory contains a subset of our full Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) lemmatization dictionary, which is itself a part of our [Modern Standard Arabic Lexical Data Resource](https://www.bitext.com/arabic-lexical-data/).

Contents
--------
The file [ara-lxd-subset.tsv](ara-lxd-subset.tsv) contains a subset of our MSA lemmatization dictionary covering the top 10,000 most frequent words appearing in Bitext's own corpus (which contains over 5B tokens and is well-balanced with respect to text typology, texts sources and verticals).

The file is in Tabbed-Separated Values (TSV) format, and has two columns:
- form: the word form itself as it appears in the corpus
- lemma: the corresponding lemma (the canonical dictionary form)
